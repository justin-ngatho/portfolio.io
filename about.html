            <p>I am a Front-end web developer located in Kenya. i have a serious passion for developing websites 
                especially for small businesses to get them started on the very competititve ecommerce market.
            </p>    
            <p>When not coding(which i do alot) i like taking long walks or talking history to my fellow history junkies. i also love reading 
                fictional novel or watching their respective fictional movies. I am also open for coffee, so do not hesitate to call me
            </p>
            <p>All in all, i am interested in the whole Front-end scope and doing interesting projects with like minded people.</p>
